# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple yet classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is a web-based version of the popular two-player game, where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on the grid to place their marks ("X" or "O").
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won and displays a congratulatory message.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset button allows the game to be restarted at any time.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is styled to be responsive, making it playable on various screen sizes.
- **New Game Option**: After a game ends, players can easily start a new game without refreshing the page.

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Click on any empty box in the grid to place your mark (either "X" or "O").
3. The game alternates between the two players.
4. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
5. Click the "Reset Game" button to restart the game or the "New Game" button to play again after a win.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interactivity.
